# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

## Introduction

This is based on a starter template for [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), with some modifications to work with R files. Refer to the [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started with lazyvim.  I have some notes on how I transitioned from lunarvim on my blog at [https://dankelley.github.io/dek_blog/2024/07/06/setting-up-lazyvim.html](https://dankelley.github.io/dek_blog/2024/07/06/setting-up-lazyvim.html).

## Customization Details

### Use a 'nerd' font in terminal settings

It helps to use a "nerd" font, so that various icons will show up in the lualine and elsewhere.  I am finding `JetBrainsMono Nerd Font` to my liking lately, and so that is what I have set for my iTerm2 profile.

### Turn off the autoformat-on-save feature (autocmds.lua BLOCK 1)

**Context.** Lazyvim was formatting files upon saves.  I liked this file at first, but started to wonder whether it was causing problems with malformed files that might confuse the LSP formatter.  I don't know for sure that this is a problem, but in any case formatting is as simple as `SPC c f` and so I turned off the feature by adding BLOCK 1 to the `.config/nvim/lua/config/autocmds.lua` file.`

Note that autoformat-on-save can be turned on and off with `SPC u f`, if desired.

### Set up for editing (and running) R files

The main action for this is in the `lua/plugins/rlang.lua` file.  I am using the underline character for assignment, because I like that scheme.  If you prefer to use the default, comment out the `opts` setting in that file.  Also, I like to use `,` for the local leader in R, and I do that in NOTE 1 of the `lua/config/options.lua` file.

### Make lower status line show file type

This is done in the `lua/plugins/lualine.lua` file.  I replaced something else that showed up as an icon that I didn't understand.  Actually, there are lots of icons that I don't understand.  One looks like a box, with a number beside it. Another is a white plus sign in a black box, with a number beside it.  And there is a question mark before name of the file type.  Also, it (sometimes) displays the last command I typed, or maybe the family of commands. All of these things -- and many more -- are mysteries to me.  But I do see merit in leaving things alone, to avoid having things look too different from the how they look on other folks' machines.  That's why I changed only one thing.

### Switch to a new colour scheme

I switched to `slate` by adding the `lua/plugins/colorscheme.lua` file.

### Use soft wrapping

I set up soft wrapping (as explained by CLark Richards) at NOTE 2 of the `lua/config/options.lua` file.

### Store copied things on system clipboard

To make any copying command also copy to the system clipboard, something I learned at about 9:42 of Reference 1, I did as at NOTE 3 of the `lua/config/options.lua` file.

### Set up telescope

To do this, I copied `lua/plugins/telescope.lua` in the supplemental materials for Reference 1.

## Prevent long-line warnings for .md files

The warning is MD013, and to make it go away, I followed advice given in Reference 2 (except that I had to change what seemed to have been a chained assignment into two assignments, to avoid a lua error message).  The results in the `lua/plugins/lint.lua` file.
