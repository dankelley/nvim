# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

## Introduction

This is based on a starter template for
[LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim), with some modifications
to work with R files. Refer to the
[documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get
started with lazyvim.  I have some notes on how I transitioned from
lunarvim on my blog at
[https://dankelley.github.io/dek_blog/2024/07/06/setting-up-lazyvim.html](https://dankelley.github.io/dek_blog/2024/07/06/setting-up-lazyvim.html).

## Customization Details

### Turn off the autoformat-on-save feature (autocmds.lua BLOCK 1)

**Context.** Lazyvim was formatting files upon saves.  I liked this file at
first, but started to wonder whether it was causing problems with malformed
files that might confuse the LSP formatter.  I don't know for sure that this is
a problem, but in any case formatting is as simple as `SPC c f` and so I turned
off the feature by adding BLOCK 1 to the
`.config/nvim/lua/config/autocmds.lua` file.`

Note that autoformat-on-save can be turned on and off with `SPC u f`, if desired.

### Set up for editing (and running) R files

The action for this is in the `lua/plugins/rlang.lua` file.
